<p>Something has happened to you since yesterday morning. Nora, what is
it?</p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
<p><span class="direction">_[going nearer to her]_.</span> <p>Christine!</p> <span class="direction">_[Listens.]_</span> <p>Hush! there’s Torvald
come home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present?
Torvald can’t bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.</p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech2"><h3>MRS LINDE.<br></h3></span></span>
<p><span class="direction">_[gathering some of the things together]_.</span> <p>Certainly—but I am not going
away from here until we have had it out with one another.</p> <span class="direction">_[She goes
into the room on the left, as HELMER comes in from the hall.]_</span></p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
<p><span class="direction">_[going up to HELMER]_.</span></p> <p>I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.</p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech3"><h3>HELMER.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>Was that the dressmaker?</p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in order. You
will see I shall look quite smart.</p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech3"><h3>HELMER.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>Wasn’t that a happy thought of mine, now?</p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>Splendid! But don’t you think it is nice of me, too, to do as you wish?</br></p>
