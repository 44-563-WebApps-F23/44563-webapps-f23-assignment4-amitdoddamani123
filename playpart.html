<p><span class="direction">_[drops her cloak]_.</span></p><p> Someone is coming now!</p> <p><span class="direction">_[Goes to the door and
listens.]_</span></p><p> No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—</p><p><span class="direction">_[opens the door and
looks out]_.</span></p> <p>No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty.</p><p><span class="direction">_[Comes
forward.]_</span></p> <p>What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it.
Such a thing couldn’t happen; it is impossible—I have three little
children.</p><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.<br><br></p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>Thanks; put it on the table.<br><br></p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
<p><span class="direction">_[doing so]_.</span></p> <p>But it is very much in want of mending.<br><br></p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
and make yourself ill.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
<p>Do they ask much for me?<br><br></p>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I
was before.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she
went away altogether?<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech1"><h3>NURSE.<br></h3></span></span>
Good heavens!—went away altogether?<br><br>

<span class="direction1"><span class="speech"><h3>NORA.<br></h3></span></span>
Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about—how
could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?<br>
