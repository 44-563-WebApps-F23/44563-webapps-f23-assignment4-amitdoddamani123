<h1> Amit acts in a play </h1>
<h4> Play: A Doll's House Act 2 </h4>
<h4>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h4>

NORA.<br>
_[drops her cloak]_. Someone is coming now! _[Goes to the door and
listens.]_ No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—_[opens the door and
looks out]_. No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. _[Comes
forward.]_ What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it.
Such a thing couldn’t happen; it is impossible—I have three little
children.<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Thanks; put it on the table.<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
_[doing so]_. But it is very much in want of mending.<br><br>

NORA.<br>
I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
and make yourself ill.<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Do they ask much for me?<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I
was before.<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she
went away altogether?<br><br>

NURSE.<br>
Good heavens!—went away altogether?<br><br>

NORA.<br>
Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about—how
could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?<br>
